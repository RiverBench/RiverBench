RiverBench is an open, community-driven RDF streaming benchmark suite. It includes a varied collection of datasets representing many RDF streaming use cases. The datasets can be used for benchmarking and testing of streaming **and** non-streaming RDF engines, compression algorithms, triple stores, and other tools.
